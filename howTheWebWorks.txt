Part One: Solidify Terminology
1. What is HTTP?

- HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a tool that is used to request and get data and/or sends data to a server.


2. What is a URL?

- URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator and it is a unique address that is used to locate a resource on the internet.


3. What is DNS?

- DNS stands for Domain Name System. This is a system that converts human-readable domain names into IP addresses.


4. What is a query string?

- A query string is a ? at the end of a url followed by a set of characters, that represents a unique key-value pairs.


5. What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?

- Two common HTTP verbs are GET and POST. GET are requests that are meant to retrieve data from a server and does not modify the server’s state. While POST sends data to the server to modify the server’s state.


6. What is an HTTP request?

- An HTTP request is a request made by a client or user to a server, mainly to access a resource on the server.


7. What is an HTTP response?

- An HTTP response is a response from a server to a client or user based on the resource requested.


8. What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen.

- HTTP Header are the additional information provided about the request or the response. Some examples of header requests are Accept-Language, Host, Cookie, Cache-control, etc. While some examples of header responses are Last-modified, Content-type, Set-cookie, etc.


9. What are the processes that happen when you type “http://somesite.com/some/page.html” into a browser?

- When we type a website into a browser, first the browser will look for the IP address of the domain name in the DNS. Then the browser initiates a connection and send a request to that IP address. Next the server receives the request and responds. After receiving the response, the browser makes a DOM from all the information it received such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. Finally, the browser displays all these resources to the client or user.
 


Part Two: Practice Tools

1. Using curl, make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find all jokes involving the word “pirate”

- https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate


2. Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com

% dig icanhazdadjoke.com

; <<>> DiG 9.10.6 <<>> icanhazdadjoke.com
;; global options: +cmd

3. Make a simple web page and serve it using python3 -m http.server. Visit the page in a browser.

~ % python3 -m http.server
